## License

Vormia is open-source and available under the MIT License.

## Testing

This package includes basic PHPUnit tests for all main Vormia Artisan commands:

- `vormia:install`
- `vormia:help`
- `vormia:update`
- `vormia:uninstall`

To run the tests:

```sh
composer install
vendor/bin/phpunit --testdox
```

You can add more tests in the `tests/` directory to cover additional functionality.

## .gitignore

The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude:

- `vendor/`, `composer.lock`, and Composer artifacts
- PHPUnit and code coverage output
- IDE/editor and OS-specific files (e.g., `.idea/`, `.DS_Store`)
- Environment files (e.g., `.env`)
- User model backups created by Vormia installer

## User Model Update Safety

When running `php artisan vormia:install`, the installer will:

- Ask if you have a backup of your `app/Models/User.php` file
- If not, it will create a timestamped backup before replacing it
- The replacement uses a stub at `src/stubs/models/User.php` for consistency and safety
